# Go Web API Template

Production-oriented starter using Gin, Uber Fx, Viper, slog + lumberjack, sqlx, Redis, NATS JetStream, JWT, robfig/cron, and golang-migrate. Fork it or change the module path before starting a separate project.


## Quick start

```bash
cp config/config.yaml config/config.local.yaml
export APP_JWT_SECRET='replace-with-at-least-32-random-bytes'
export APP_AUTH_CLIENT_ID='local-client'
export APP_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET='local-secret'
go run ./cmd/api -config config/config.local.yaml
```

For the complete local stack (API, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis and automatic migrations):

```bash
make dev-up
# API http://127.0.0.1:8080, gRPC 127.0.0.1:9090
# MySQL 127.0.0.1:3306, PostgreSQL 127.0.0.1:5432, Redis 127.0.0.1:6379
make dev-logs
make dev-down
```

If the default Go module proxy is unavailable on your network, override it only for the build, for example `GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct make dev-up`.

Release metadata is injected automatically at build time. `make build`, `make docker-build`, and `make dev-up` embed the Git-derived version, full commit SHA, and UTC build time into the API binary. Docker images also expose the same values as OCI labels. Override them when needed with `VERSION=v1.2.3 COMMIT=<sha> BUILD_TIME=<RFC3339>`.

```bash
make docker-build
docker inspect config-service:$(git describe --tags --always --dirty) \
  --format '{{json .Config.Labels}}'
./bin/api -version
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/version
```

The Compose `compose` profile runs the API against PostgreSQL while also migrating MySQL for compatibility work. The development stack intentionally does not start Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger or an OTel Collector.

## Container publishing and Kubernetes

After unit and integration tests pass, CI builds `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` images and publishes `main`, `sha-*`, and semantic-version tags to `ghcr.io/lihongjie0209/config-service`. Images include Git metadata, an SBOM, and build provenance. Pull requests build both architectures without publishing.

The production baseline in `deployments/kubernetes.yaml` includes HTTP/gRPC Service ports, rolling updates, startup/liveness/readiness probes, resource limits, HPA, PDB, topology spreading, a restricted security context, and NetworkPolicy. Create the Secret outside Git using `deployments/secret.example.yaml` as a field reference, run the migration Job, and then deploy the service:

```bash
kubectl create namespace config-service --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl create secret generic config-service --namespace config-service \
  --from-literal=APP_DATABASE_DSN='postgres://user:password@postgres:5432/app?sslmode=require' \
  --from-literal=APP_REDIS_ADDRESS='redis:6379' \
  --from-literal=APP_REDIS_PASSWORD='replace-me' \
  --from-literal=APP_JWT_SECRET='replace-with-at-least-32-random-bytes' \
  --from-literal=APP_AUTH_CLIENT_ID='replace-me' \
  --from-literal=APP_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET='replace-me'
kubectl apply -f deployments/migrate-job.yaml
kubectl wait --namespace config-service --for=condition=complete job/config-service-migrate --timeout=5m
kubectl apply -f deployments/kubernetes.yaml
```

Replace the example values through your secret manager in production. The NetworkPolicy assumes DNS uses the standard `k8s-app=kube-dns` label and allows dependency egress only on DNS, MySQL/PostgreSQL, Redis, OTLP/HTTP, and HTTPS ports; adapt selectors and ports to the target cluster.

## Shared gRPC contracts

Business gRPC definitions come only from the released `platform-protos` module. This service does not own local Proto or generated stubs; lint, breaking checks, generation, and release happen in the central contract repository.

All nested config keys can be overridden with `APP_` environment variables: `database.name` becomes `APP_DATABASE_NAME` and `database.dsn` becomes `APP_DATABASE_DSN`. Environment values override the YAML file. Keep secrets out of YAML and source control.

`microgen` optionally reads `.microgen.yaml` (preferred) or `microgen.yaml` from the current directory. Values in that file act as defaults; `MICROGEN_*` environment variables and explicit flags override them. For example:

```yaml
namespace: commerce
module: github.com/acme/orders-service
database-name: orders_service
database-schema: orders_service
migration-table: orders_service_schema_migrations
```

Environment profiles work like Spring Boot: load `config.yaml`, then an optional sibling `config-{env}.yaml`, then apply environment variables. Select the profile with `-env production` or `APP_ENV=production`; the flag has the highest priority. The active profile and loaded file list are available through `config.Config.Runtime`, while the profile is also placed in HTTP/gRPC contexts through `environment.FromContext` and attached to every structured log entry.

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"client_id":"local-client","client_secret":"local-secret"}'
```

Business endpoints use POST with JSON; operational probes also expose GET for Docker/Kubernetes. Responses always use:

```json
{"code":0,"message":"success","body":{}}
```

## Error codes

| Range | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | success | `0` |
| `10000-19999` | protocol/input/common | invalid argument `10001`, not found `10004`, throttled `10029` |
| `20000-29999` | authentication/authorization | unauthorized `20001`, forbidden `20003` |
| `30000-39999` | business rules | conflict `30009` |
| `50000-59999` | server/infrastructure | internal `50000`, dependency unavailable `50003` |

HTTP status codes remain semantically correct; clients should use `code` for stable application behavior. Technical errors are logged and never returned to clients.

## Database

Set `APP_DATABASE_ENABLED=true`, `APP_DATABASE_TYPE`, and `APP_DATABASE_DSN`.

- MySQL: type `mysql`, DSN `user:pass@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/app?parseTime=true`
- PostgreSQL: type `postgres`, DSN `postgres://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/app?sslmode=disable`
- KingbaseES: type `kingbase`, using its PostgreSQL-compatible wire protocol through pgx; use a Kingbase-compatible PostgreSQL DSN. If your installation mandates official Gokb, add its private module import and map `kingbase` to driver name `kingbase` in `internal/database/database.go`.

The official Kingbase documentation describes Gokb as a pure-Go `database/sql` driver registered as `kingbase`, but distribution commonly accompanies the product rather than a stable public Go module.

## Redis lock and scheduled jobs

Distributed locking is implemented with [`go-redsync/redsync/v4`](https://github.com/go-redsync/redsync). The local `cache.Locker` adapter provides non-blocking `TryLock`, context-aware retrying `Lock`, ownership-safe `Unlock`, explicit `Extend`, and the lock validity deadline through `Until`. The sample six-field cron job demonstrates cross-instance locking.

Redsync does not start a hidden renewal goroutine. Long-running jobs must call `Extend` before `Until`, or stop work when extension fails. This keeps goroutine ownership and lock-loss behavior explicit.

## HTTP operations and security

- `GET|POST /live`: process liveness
- `GET|POST /ready`: database and Redis readiness with independent timeouts
- `GET /metrics`: Prometheus metrics when enabled
- `POST /api/v1/version`: version, commit, build time, start time and uptime
- `POST /api/v1/users/create|get|list|update|delete`: JWT-protected CRUD example
- `GET /swagger/index.html`: generated Swagger UI when enabled

Every request accepts or generates `X-Request-ID`; it is returned in the response header and JSON envelope and correlated with OpenTelemetry trace/span IDs in logs. Request deadlines are propagated through `Request.Context`, so context-aware SQL and Redis calls stop after client cancellation or timeout.

Redis-backed GCRA limits are configurable for IP, API route, authenticated user and login brute-force protection. Set `APP_REDIS_ENABLED=true` and `APP_RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true` to enable them. `rate_limit.fail_open` controls behavior when Redis is unavailable and defaults to secure fail-closed mode.

Configure `http.trusted_proxies` explicitly before trusting forwarding headers. CORS is deny-by-default, JSON bodies require `application/json`, and baseline browser security headers are enabled globally.

JWT bypass and PSK policies are configuration-driven. `auth.skip_http_paths` and `auth.skip_grpc_methods` bypass authentication; `auth.psk.http_paths` and `auth.psk.grpc_methods` require `Authorization: PSK <key>` and take precedence over bypass/JWT rules. Patterns use Go `path.Match`: `*` and `?` are supported but do not cross `/`. Enable PSK with `APP_AUTH_PSK_ENABLED=true` and inject a key of at least 32 bytes through `APP_AUTH_PSK_KEY`; never store a production key in YAML.

Authenticated JWT and PSK callers are injected into the request `context.Context` through `internal/principal`; application and repository code should read this principal when constructing explicit audit fields. NATS JetStream is available through `internal/eventbus` and is disabled by default. Domain writes that publish events must first persist them in the same database transaction through a service-owned outbox; the bus publisher must only dispatch committed rows. Consumers use durable names, explicit acknowledgements, redelivery, and idempotent processing.

## OpenAPI and observability

Generate the checked-in Swagger contract with `make swagger`. CI regenerates `docs/` and fails when it differs from the committed output. JWT-protected operations declare the `Bearer` security scheme. In production, Swagger can only be enabled when `swagger.require_auth=true`.

Prometheus exports bounded-cardinality HTTP latency/status metrics, database pool metrics, Redis pool metrics, Go/process metrics and Cron execution metrics. Enable OTLP/HTTP tracing with:

```bash
export APP_OBSERVABILITY_TRACING_ENABLED=true
export APP_OBSERVABILITY_TRACING_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4318
export APP_OBSERVABILITY_TRACING_SAMPLE_RATIO=0.1
```

pprof is disabled by default. Enabling it requires an independent Bearer token of at least 32 bytes:

```bash
export APP_OBSERVABILITY_PPROF_ENABLED=true
export APP_OBSERVABILITY_PPROF_TOKEN='replace-with-a-separate-32-byte-token'
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $APP_OBSERVABILITY_PPROF_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8080/debug/pprof/
```

## gRPC server and client

The gRPC server listens independently on `127.0.0.1:9090`, is managed by the same Fx lifecycle, and implements its released central `platform.config.v1` contract.

- `hello.v1.UserService/*`: CRUD RPCs backed by the same service as HTTP
- `grpc.health.v1.Health/Check`: unauthenticated standard readiness check
- JWT is passed as `authorization: Bearer <token>` metadata
- `x-request-id` and W3C trace context propagate across HTTP-to-gRPC calls
- reflection is enabled for development and forbidden in production
- production configuration requires TLS; setting `client_ca_file` enables mTLS

For outbound calls, use `internal/grpcclient.Dial`; it reuses the HTTP/2 connection, applies a default deadline, supports TLS/mTLS and refuses to send bearer credentials over plaintext unless explicitly allowed for development.

```go
conn, err := grpcclient.Dial(grpcclient.Config{
    Target:  "dns:///other-service:9090",
    Timeout: 5 * time.Second,
    Token:   accessToken,
    TLS:     grpcclient.TLSConfig{Enabled: true, ServerName: "other-service"},
})
if err != nil { /* handle */ }
defer conn.Close()

```

For a PSK-protected upstream, set `PSK` instead of `Token`; the client sends `Authorization: PSK <key>`. Bearer and PSK are mutually exclusive and both require TLS by default.

## Migrations

The example user migrations are separated under `migrations/mysql`, `migrations/postgres`, and `migrations/kingbase`. Set `APP_MIGRATION_PATH` to the directory matching `APP_DATABASE_TYPE`, set `APP_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`, then run:

```bash
make migrate-up
make migrate-down
go run ./cmd/migrate -steps 1
go run ./cmd/migrate -steps -1
```

Set `APP_MIGRATION_AUTO_UP=true` to run all pending migrations before each service process starts its database pool, scheduler, HTTP server, or gRPC server. Startup fails when migration fails. Concurrent replicas are serialized by the database migration lock, and replicas that acquire the lock later observe `ErrNoChange` and continue. Keep destructive/down migrations as an explicit deployment operation; automatic startup only runs `up`.

Every service must set its own `APP_MIGRATION_TABLE`, for example `orders_service_schema_migrations`. The value is passed to the database driver as `x-migrations-table`; both migration history and the advisory lock are therefore isolated when services share one physical database. Table names are restricted to lowercase letters, digits, and underscores and to PostgreSQL's 63-character identifier limit.

PostgreSQL and Kingbase services may also share one database while using independent schemas. Set `APP_DATABASE_SCHEMA` (or `--database-schema` when generating) and the application connection will enforce that schema as `search_path`; startup migrations use the same schema, including their service-specific history table. Set `APP_MIGRATION_CREATE_SCHEMA=true` only when the runtime role is allowed to create schemas (enabled in Compose); production defaults to false so the platform/DBA can provision the schema with least privilege. MySQL ignores the schema setting and uses the selected database name.

The Compose and Kubernetes examples enable startup migration for the primary PostgreSQL database. The standalone migration command and Kubernetes migration Job remain available for controlled release pipelines or maintenance operations.

Use a `mysql://` URL for MySQL and `postgres://` for PostgreSQL/Kingbase. The sample schema and indexes still require review against real data volume and access patterns.

## User module example

`internal/user` demonstrates explicit SQL repositories, context propagation, a transaction boundary on create, optimistic locking through `version`, pagination, normalized input validation, Redis read-through caching, and a redsync lock keyed by a SHA-256 digest of the email. HTTP and gRPC are transport adapters over the same service.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/users/create \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Alice","email":"alice@example.com"}'
```

Updates and deletes must send the current `version`; stale writes return application code `30009`.

## Idempotency

Enable Redis-backed idempotency with `APP_IDEMPOTENCY_ENABLED=true`. Send an `Idempotency-Key` containing 8–128 safe ASCII characters on HTTP or `idempotency-key` metadata on gRPC. User creation stores `processing`, `completed`, or `failed` state; the same key and request replays the original business result, concurrent execution returns `30010`, and reusing a key with different input returns `30009`.

The Redis state transition uses Lua plus an owner token, so an expired worker cannot overwrite a newer owner. The database transaction commits before the completed result is published; unique database constraints remain the final integrity boundary.

## Outbound clients

Named HTTP and gRPC clients are created once by the Fx-managed outbound registry. Both support Bearer/PSK, TLS/mTLS, deadline propagation, bounded exponential retry, Sony gobreaker, Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry propagation. Credentials require TLS. POST/RPC retries are only enabled for configured safe gRPC methods or calls carrying an idempotency key.

```yaml
outbound:
  http:
    billing:
      base_url: https://billing.example.com
      timeout: 5s
      auth: {type: psk, token: ""} # inject per environment
      retry: {max_attempts: 3, initial_backoff: 100ms, max_backoff: 1s}
      breaker: {enabled: true, failure_threshold: 5, open_timeout: 30s}
      tls: {enabled: true, server_name: billing.example.com}
  grpc:
    inventory:
      target: dns:///inventory:9090
      timeout: 5s
      auth: {type: bearer, token: ""}
      retry:
        max_attempts: 3
        initial_backoff: 100ms
        max_backoff: 1s
        methods: [/inventory.v1.InventoryService/Get*]
      breaker: {enabled: true, failure_threshold: 5, open_timeout: 30s}
      tls: {enabled: true, server_name: inventory}
```

## Verification

```bash
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
make test-integration # requires Docker; runs Testcontainers MySQL/PostgreSQL/Redis and HTTP/gRPC E2E tests
golangci-lint run ./...
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs unit/race/vet/generated-code checks and the integration suite as separate jobs.
